    <h2>This page was created by <a href=" about.html ">Jompol Sermsook</a><small>(click on my name to learn more about me.)</small></h2>

    <p> This isn't the first time I write a webpage with HTML but it's the first time I write it without any css framework or template
    </p>

    <pre>           <b>[On the first 2 line I use tag h1 & 2 which means header so it's come with big bold text
        and the next line I use tag p which means paragraph to type text in it but it can't custom much
        so this text(in squre bucket) I use tag pre which means preformatted text to custom text layout as I want.]</b></pre>
